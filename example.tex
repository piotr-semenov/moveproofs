Let's prove some theorems! Because ``location" was set to \ifmoveproofstoappendix ``appendix'', \else ``inline'', \fi the proofs will appear \ifmoveproofstoappendix in the appendix. \else inline, and no appendix will be displayed. \fi

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem_one}
Given $\delta \in (0, 1)$, with probability $1 - \delta$, proofs are useful.
\end{theorem}

Proofs are great! Therefore, we have our result.
